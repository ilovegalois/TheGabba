GAME IDEA

2D Game made in unity player spwans in the middle of the map, in ethier side of the map (Left,Right,Top,Down) there is a house with an npc,
all the npc are sometype of seller that is gonna give upgrades to the player (armor,guns,health,..etc) , in the spawn point there is a stone or some type of summon area
where the player can interact to go to night time, when the player press this summon area he will be teleported to a new scene, this scene will be an only room with 1 hole from every direction (Top,Down,Left,Right)
, the scene will play like a forest at night so there has to be trees in all the sides with some type of entrene for enemies, the player cant leave this scene till he kills an spesific ammount of enemies, after he kills the enemies he will get gold based on how good he did (DID HE RECIVIED DGM, HOW FAST DID HE FINSIH THE ROOM, ETC..)
the game is a loop of this function till the player dies.
